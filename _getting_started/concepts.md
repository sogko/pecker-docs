#### What is an asset?
An asset is simply any type of content that you want to make available on a HTML page in your web application.

This includes &mdash; but not limited to:

* images
* audio files
* scripts
* stylesheets
* icons
* external URL resources
* and many more!

#### What kind of assets are supported?

<div style="text-align:center;">
<strong>EVERY ONE OF THEM.</strong>

</div>

In all seriousness, every kind of assets can be supported and managed using Pecker framework.

In Pecker, any kind of asset can fall into at least one of the following Pecker-defined **asset types**:

* a physical file (i.e. a **file asset**), for eg: JavaScript scripts, CSS/Less/Sass stylesheets
* an entire folder and its content (including sub-folders) (i.e. a **folder asset**)
* a URL referring to an external file asset (i.e. a **URL asset** hosted in a CDN)
* a CommonJS module that can be browserified (i.e.  a **browserify** asset, a special asset type)
* an ordered set of assets (i.e. an asset **package**); can also include another asset package (**nested package**)
