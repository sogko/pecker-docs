In the most general sense, Pecker recognizes any type of content as an asset.
<br/>As long as you can serve the file from your server, it is an asset for you and your web application.

Pecker has defined five (5) asset types to help you manage your assets easily:

* `file`
* `folder`
* `browserify`
* `url`
* `package`
