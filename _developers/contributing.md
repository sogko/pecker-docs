The first step in contributing to the code base is forking the repo.

If you have an existing fork, make the repo is up-to-date. Always create the branch off the actively developed branch (typically develop or master)

**For bug fixes:**

* Create a branch
* Once the bug has been fixed with sufficient testing submit a pull request
If there is an existing open issue, reference the issue number in the pull request description.

**For new features:**

Open a ticket thoroughly describing the feature. The more detail you provide, the better. After at least one of core developers responds or triages the ticket and says it's a go, follow the steps:

* Create a branch
* Once implemented with tests and documentation, submit a pull request referencing the open ticket.

**For documentation:**

* Create a branch or edit the file
* Submit a pull request
